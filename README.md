## Summary:

A uniquely experienced and successful software development leader who has designed and developed many different types of business software applications, websites and systems over the past 20 years, and who has lead teams and organizations to consistent and predictable high performance, seeks a leadership position in creating high-value enterprise software systems and technology platforms for a dynamic and growing business.  

Michael has designed, developed and maintained a wide variety of applications and systems in different industries, including digital marketing, healthcare, insurance, finance, telecommunications and logistics.

Michael has 20 years of experience creating and evolving all types of software, including web sites, apps, services, daemons, agents, desktop UIs, libraries, microservices and web platforms, REST and SOAP services, distributed systems, schemas and databases, and ETL pipelines.

Michael has worked in many different technologies and languages, including Java, Spring, PHP, Python, Javascript, Node, Scala, React, Angular, Express, jQuery, jQueryUI, HTML, CSS, MySQL, SQL Server, Postgres, Cassandra, HDFS, C#, VB.NET, ASP.NET, JSP, JSON, REST and more.

Michael is an expert and leader in writing "clean code" and building highly maintainable and testable software by leveraging enterprise patterns and frameworks, best practices and principles, and modern tooling and processes, which lead to repeatable and predictable project success.

Michael excels at migrating and improving existing apps, databases and whole systems, evolving them into maintainable and modern software systems which follow best practices and patterns and leverage appropriate technology. Cloud-native, platform-independent, '12-factor' apps don't have to be built that way from scratch: You can start with whatever you've got, and "get there", without breaking any customer experience along the way.  Michael can show you how.

Michael is a skilled and experienced product developer and manager, able to seamlessly combine product requirements, analysis and design with the software development process. For Michael, software development *is* product development plus software engineering.  This approach arises from his years as a software development consultant as well as his years of experience as an entrepreneur in other industries.

Michael has lead teams of software professionals to repeatable success, and provided oversight, leadership, mentoring and training to entire software development organizations, comprised of many teams containing both local and offshore talent. Michael's peers and subordinates can speak to his skill, experience and enthusiasm in this role.

Michael’s formal education in the humanities and social sciences, and unusual prior experience in sales, marketing and business ownership, gives him insights, perspectives, wisdom and capabilities which he leverages to solve technical and business challenges within the field of software development and the profession of software engineering and architecture.

Michael is a talented and experienced software engineer, architect, product developer and manager, as well as a counselor, coach and leader.
